## Generated Documentation

- `doc/api/` contains artifacts generated by `dart doc`.
- Do not manually edit files inside `doc/api/`.

## Technical Notes

- `doc/notes/` stores supporting notes and point-in-time investigations.
- Files in `doc/notes/` do not replace canonical documents.
- Current performance/reliability plan: [PERFORMANCE_RELIABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](notes/PERFORMANCE_RELIABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## Maintenance Rules

1. Avoid creating parallel documents for the same topic. Update the canonical document.
2. When a document becomes historical, remove it from the index and delete the file.
3. Always validate internal links after major edits.
4. For release/versioning changes, keep `pubspec.yaml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and docs synchronized.
