## 0. Transaction control — Sprint 4 (Planned)

The v3.1.0 release closed the four critical bugs (B1, B2, B4, B7) and
shipped the Dart safety helpers (`runWithBegin`, `withSavepoint`,
`Finalizable`). Sprint 4 covers the optional / advanced surface that did
**not** make it into v3.1 because none of it is required for correctness.

### ~~4.1 `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY`~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.4.0)

Sibling enum `TransactionAccessMode { readWrite, readOnly }` exposed
end-to-end (Rust core → FFI v2 → Dart bindings → Service). PostgreSQL /
MySQL / MariaDB / DB2 / Oracle emit `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY`; SQL
Server / SQLite / Snowflake silently no-op. v1 FFI ABI preserved.
Verified by 8 unit tests + 4 E2E tests (`tests/e2e_transaction_access_mode_test.rs`).
See CHANGELOG `[3.4.0] / Added` for the full surface.

### ~~4.2 Lock / statement timeouts per transaction~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.4.0)

`engine::LockTimeout` typed wrapper exposed end-to-end (Rust core →
FFI v3 → Dart `Duration?` → Service). Engine matrix: SQL Server emits
`SET LOCK_TIMEOUT <ms>`; PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '<n>ms'`
(auto-resets on commit/rollback); MySQL/MariaDB and DB2 use the
session-wide seconds-granular variants with sub-second values rounding
UP to 1s; SQLite uses `PRAGMA busy_timeout = <ms>`; Oracle/Snowflake
silently no-op. v1/v2 ABIs preserved via v3 delegation. Verified by
12 unit tests + 4 E2E tests
(`tests/e2e_transaction_lock_timeout_test.rs`).

### ~~4.3 XA / two-phase commit (PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, DB2)~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.4.0)

`engine::xa_transaction` ships first-class XA support with a
strongly-typed state machine ([`Xid`] → [`XaTransaction`] →
[`PreparingXa`] → [`PreparedXa`]) plus crash recovery via
[`recover_prepared_xids`] / [`resume_prepared`]. SQL-level XA grammar
emitted natively for PostgreSQL (`PREPARE TRANSACTION` +
`pg_prepared_xacts`), MySQL/MariaDB (`XA START / END / PREPARE /
COMMIT / ROLLBACK / RECOVER`), and DB2 (same SQL grammar). 1RM
optimisation (`commit_one_phase`) skips the prepare-log write when
this RM is the sole participant. 10 new FFI exports + Dart
[`XaTransactionHandle`] expose the lifecycle end-to-end. Verified by
19 Rust unit tests + 17 Dart unit tests + 9 gated E2E tests covering
the full 2PC lifecycle including resume-after-disconnect.

### 4.3b XA on SQL Server (MSDTC) — Phase 1 implemented; Phase 2 pending

**Phase 1 (v3.4.0) — scaffolding landed**:

- New module `engine::xa_dtc` behind `--features xa-dtc`
  (Windows-only).
- Pulls the `windows` 0.59 crate (high-level COM bindings).
- COM ceremony complete: `CoInitializeEx` (cached),
  `DtcGetTransactionManagerExA`, `ITransactionDispenser::BeginTransaction`,
  `ITransaction::Commit/Abort`. Owned `DtcXaBranch` handle with
  `Drop` cleanup that recognises `XACT_E_NOTRANSACTION`.
- Cross-vendor `unsupported_sqlserver()` is now feature-aware: it
  distinguishes "feature missing" from "feature enabled but Phase 2
  wiring pending", which is what callers see today.

**Phase 2 — pending**:

- Wire `engine::xa_dtc::begin_dtc_branch()` into the cross-vendor
  `apply_xa_*` matrix in `xa_transaction.rs`.
- Call `SQLSetConnectAttr(SQL_ATTR_ENLIST_IN_DTC, ITransaction*)`
  on the ODBC connection handle to enlist the connection in the
  MSDTC transaction. (The `odbc-api` crate doesn't expose this
  attribute directly — needs the raw escape hatch via
  `Connection::as_ptr()` + manual `SQLSetConnectAttrW`.)
- Implement crash recovery via `IResourceManager::Reenlist`.
- Add gated E2E tests under `tests/regression/xa_dtc_test.rs` with
  `cargo test --features xa-dtc -- --ignored --test-threads=1`
  against a Windows host with `sc query MSDTC` reporting `RUNNING`.

### ~~4.3c XA on Oracle~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.4.1) via `DBMS_XA` PL/SQL

**Production path — `DBMS_XA` (v3.4.1)**:

- `apply_xa_*` matrix in `xa_transaction.rs` emits PL/SQL calls into
  `SYS.DBMS_XA` (`XA_START`, `XA_END`, `XA_PREPARE`, `XA_COMMIT`,
  `XA_ROLLBACK`) using `SYS.DBMS_XA_XID` constructors with
  `HEXTORAW` literals. Recovery reads `DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS`
  with `RAWTOHEX(GLOBALID)` / `RAWTOHEX(BRANCHID)` for round-trip.
- Read-only branches surface as `XA_RDONLY` (rc=3) on `XA_PREPARE`
  and are silently accepted; the follow-up `XA_COMMIT(FALSE)`
  tolerates `XAER_NOTA` (rc=-4) so the read-only path is a no-op.
- Validated end-to-end against Oracle XE 21 in the docker
  `test-runner-oracle` profile (4 tests in
  `tests/e2e_xa_transaction_test.rs`):
  - full 2PC commit (start → INSERT → end → prepare → commit)
  - 2PC rollback prepared (verifies row absence + recovery clear)
  - one-phase commit shortcut
  - resume prepared XID after disconnect (cross-session recovery)
- Required Oracle privileges on the connection user: `EXECUTE` on
  `DBMS_XA` (default for `system`), `FORCE [ANY] TRANSACTION` (for
  recovery on prepared XIDs from other sessions), `SELECT` on
  `DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS`.
- Cross-vendor `unsupported_oracle()` removed; `unsupported_other()`
  now lists Oracle as supported.

**Alternative OCI path — deferred (Phase 1 scaffolding kept)**:

- `engine::xa_oci` behind `--features xa-oci` retains the dynamic-
  loading shim for `xaosw`/`xaocl`/`xaostart`/.../`xaorecover`
  symbols and an owned `OciXaBranch` handle. Useful as documented
  ABI for OCI XA and a possible future option *if* `odbc-api` ever
  exposes the underlying `OCIServer*` handle so the OCI session
  can share state with the ODBC connection.
- Today the OCI path is **not wired** into `apply_xa_*`; production
  Oracle XA flows entirely through `DBMS_XA`.

### ~~4.4 `runInTransaction` exposed natively in the Service layer~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.4.0)

`IOdbcService.runInTransaction<T>(connId, action, {isolationLevel,
savepointDialect, accessMode, lockTimeout})` ships in
`OdbcService` with a tracing wrapper in
`TelemetryOdbcServiceDecorator`. Honours the
`begin → action → commit/rollback` contract atomically: action throws
become `QueryError` (typed catch in the action's stack), action
`Failure` rolls back and propagates verbatim, `commit` failure surfaces
as the unit-of-work failure, and rollback failures during cleanup are
swallowed so they never overwrite the original cause. Verified by
9 Dart unit tests in
`test/application/services/odbc_service_run_in_transaction_test.dart`.

## 1. Output parameters by driver/plugin

### Current state

- No public API for output parameters.
- Engine/plugin extension points exist, but no stable Dart contract yet.
- Driver roadmap matrix and decision criteria are documented in
  `doc/notes/TYPE_MAPPING.md` (section `Output parameters roadmap`).

### Current decision

- Out of immediate scope.
- Revisit when there is a concrete driver-specific requirement (for
  example: SQL Server OUTPUT, Oracle REF CURSOR).

## 2. `SqlDataType` extended kinds (incremental)

v3.0.0 shipped 10 kinds (`int32`, `int64`, `decimal`, `varChar`,
`nVarChar`, `varBinary`, `dateTime`, `date`, `time`, `boolAsInt32`).
**v3.4.0 adds 17 more**:

- Cross-engine batch 1 (smallInt, bigInt, json, uuid, money)
- Cross-engine batch 2 (tinyInt, bit, text, xml, interval)
- Engine-specific batch (range, cidr, tsvector, hierarchyId,
  geography, raw, bfile)

See CHANGELOG `[3.4.0] / Added` and
`test/infrastructure/native/protocol/param_value_test.dart` for the
full validation matrix per kind.

The 27 kinds now shipped cover every common SQL data type for
PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle and SQLite — including
PostgreSQL ranges/cidr/tsvector, SQL Server hierarchyid/geography,
and Oracle raw/bfile. The 3 remaining slots in the original 30-kind
roadmap are reserved for future spatial/temporal additions
(geometry, year/month interval, json with schema validation) when
concrete consumers ask for them.

## 3. Known test infrastructure issues (low priority)

These are **not** product bugs — they affect test runs against specific
local infrastructures. Documented here so they don't get re-discovered
each release cycle.

### ~~3.1 `test_ffi_get_structured_error` is flaky in parallel~~ — ✅ FIXED (v3.4.0)

The previous implementation triggered the structured error via
`trigger_structured_cancel_unsupported_error()`, released the global
state lock, and only then called the public `odbc_get_structured_error`
FFI to read it back. Any parallel test calling a function that invokes
`set_error()` (which clears `state.last_structured_error` as a
side-effect, see `set_error` at `ffi/mod.rs:570`) could clobber the
injected value in that window. `#[serial]` only serialised against
other `#[serial]` tests, not the broader set of FFI tests that touch
`set_error` indirectly.

The fix collapses inject + read into a single critical section by
holding the global state lock across both operations and inlining the
same algorithm `odbc_get_structured_error` uses. Verified by 5
consecutive `cargo test --lib` runs with 0 failures (was an
intermittent failure documented since v3.0).

### 3.2 `e2e_pool_test` / `e2e_savepoint_test` hang on slow DSN

- **Why**: those tests acquire pool connections with the default 30 s
  timeout; when the local SQL Server is slow to respond (login throttling,
  cold start) the test driver waits the full timeout for every individual
  test. Surfaces as the run "hanging" until cargo test eventually times
  out.
- **Workaround**: gate-controlled by `ENABLE_E2E_TESTS=1`; not part of
  the default `cargo test --lib` flow.
- **Fix sketch**: lower the per-test pool `connection_timeout` to 5 s and
  fail fast with a clear error.

## ~~4. Schema reflection (PK/FK/Indexes)~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implemented on**: 2026-03-10.

- ✅ Rust: `list_primary_keys`, `list_foreign_keys`, `list_indexes` in
  `catalog.rs`.
- ✅ FFI: `odbc_catalog_primary_keys`, `odbc_catalog_foreign_keys`,
  `odbc_catalog_indexes`.
- ✅ Dart: full binding → repository → service chain.
- ✅ Example: `example/catalog_reflection_demo.dart`.

## ~~5. Explicit SQL typing API (`SqlDataType`)~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implemented on**: v3.0.0 (`SqlDataType` + `SqlTypedValue` +
`typedParam`).

- ✅ 10 kinds shipped, validation per kind, integrated into
  `toParamValue` / `paramValuesFromObjects` (non-breaking).
- ✅ Reference: `doc/notes/TYPE_MAPPING.md` §1.3.
- See section 2 above for the incremental backlog of additional kinds.

## ~~6. Multi-result hardening (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7)~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.2.0)

| Tag | Description                                             | Status     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| M1  | `collect_multi_results` walks all 4 batch shapes        | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M2  | `odbc_exec_query_multi` accepts pooled IDs              | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M3  | `MultiResultItem` (Dart) sealed class                   | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M4  | Wire format magic + version v2 (decoder accepts v1 too) | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M5  | `executeQueryMultiParams` (FFI + Dart cadeia)           | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M6  | `executeQueryMulti` single via `firstResultSetOrNull`   | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M7  | `getFirstResultSet` returns `ParsedRowBuffer?`          | ✅ v3.2.0 |
| M8  | Streaming multi-result (frame-based wire)               | ✅ v3.3.0 |
| M9  | E2E coverage for batch-shape regressions                | ✅ v3.2.0 |

See `CHANGELOG.md` entries for v3.2.0 and v3.3.0 for the full surface.

## ~~7. UTF-16 wide-text column decoding~~ — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v3.3.0)

`engine/cell_reader.rs` reads text columns through
`SQLGetData(SQL_C_WCHAR)` (UTF-16 LE) and transcodes to UTF-8 via
`String::from_utf16_lossy`. Resolves the `"¹ÜÀíÔ±"` mojibake bug for
non-ASCII text outside the client's ANSI code page (issue #1). 4 new
E2E tests in `tests/e2e_sqlserver_test.rs` (FOR JSON PATH + Chinese
unicode round-trip).

## Criteria to move from open to implemented

1. Public API defined and documented.
2. Unit and integration tests covering main flow.
3. Working example in `example/` (when applicable).
4. Entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
