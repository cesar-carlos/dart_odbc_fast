# Continuous Integration Workflow
#
# Purpose: Complete CI validation for development and releases
# Scope: Full validation with Rust dependency caching and multi-target support
# Triggers: Push to main/develop branches and pull requests to main
# Platforms: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS (with x86_64 and aarch64 targets)
#
# For simplified M1 milestone validation, see m1_validation.yml
