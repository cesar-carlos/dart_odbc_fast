# M1 Validation Workflow
# 
# Purpose: Validates Milestone 1 (Functional Binding) - basic Rust <-> Dart FFI connectivity
# Scope: Simplified validation without caching for quick milestone verification
# Triggers: Push to main branch or manual dispatch
# Platforms: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
#
# For full CI with caching and multi-branch support, see ci.yml
