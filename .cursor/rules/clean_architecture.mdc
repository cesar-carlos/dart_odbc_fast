# Clean Architecture (Generic)

## Layers

- **Domain**: pure business rules (no Flutter, no IO, no infrastructure)
- **Application**: use-case orchestration (depends on Domain + Core)
- **Infrastructure**: implementations (depends on Domain + Core)
- **Presentation**: UI/state (depends on Application + Domain + Core)
- **Core/Shared**: cross-cutting code

## Dependency Rules

- **Domain**
  - may import only core/shared and domain
  - must not import application/infrastructure/presentation
  - must not import framework-specific packages

- **Application**
  - may import domain and core
  - must not import infrastructure or presentation
  - should depend on abstractions

- **Infrastructure**
  - may import domain and core
  - must not import application or presentation
  - implements domain contracts

- **Presentation**
  - may import application/domain/core
  - must not import infrastructure directly
  - contains rendering and UI state only

## Guidance

- Keep domain technology-agnostic.
- Move side effects to infrastructure.
- Prefer focused components and use cases.
