# Rules Index

## Behavioral Guardrails

- ❌ Never commit, push, or create docs unless explicitly requested
- ✅ Prefer self-explanatory code via naming and structure

## Rules (single source of truth per topic)

### Generic (reusable)

- **`general_rules.mdc`**: core coding principles (readability, duplication, docs/comments policy)
- **`clean_architecture.mdc`**: layer boundaries and dependency direction (generic)
- **`coding_style.mdc`**: Dart language/style (naming, formatting, imports, modern Dart, logging, codegen)
- **`null_safety.mdc`**: sound null-safety guidelines and patterns
- **`solid_principles.mdc`**: SOLID principles with examples
- **`flutter_widgets.mdc`**: widget construction/performance patterns (composition, const, lists, layout, theming tokens)
- **`ui_ux_design.mdc`**: desktop UI/UX principles (Fluent vs Material policy, navigation, a11y, responsive desktop)
- **`testing.mdc`**: unit/widget testing conventions (AAA, naming, isolation, mocking)
- **`rust_style.mdc`**: Rust native code rules (rustfmt, clippy, API design, FFI safety)
- **`error_handling.mdc`**: unified error handling policy and suppression allowlist (Dart + Rust)

### Project-specific

- There is no `project_specifics.mdc` currently.

## Copying to other projects

See `README.md` in this folder. Keep generic rules and create project-specific rules only when needed.
