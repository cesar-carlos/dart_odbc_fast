# SOLID Principles

## SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

- A class should have one reason to change.
- Split validation, persistence, and orchestration concerns.

## OCP - Open/Closed Principle

- Prefer extension through interfaces and composition.
- Avoid editing stable code paths when adding new behavior.

## LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must honor the base contract.
- Do not change expected behavior in overrides.

## ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

- Prefer small focused interfaces over large generic ones.
- Clients should depend only on the members they use.

## DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

- Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- Define contracts in domain/application boundaries.
- Bind implementations in infrastructure/composition root.

## Checklist

- [ ] Responsibilities are separated by concern.
- [ ] Extensions avoid modifications to stable modules.
- [ ] Interfaces are small and cohesive.
- [ ] High-level modules depend on abstractions.
