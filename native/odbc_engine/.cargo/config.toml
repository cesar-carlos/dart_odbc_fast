# Sanitizers removed to improve build time in CI/CD
# AddressSanitizer and UBsanitizer were doubling build times (10-15 min → 3-5 min)
# For development, you can enable sanitizers via environment variable if needed:
# RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fsanitize=address -C link-arg=-fsanitize=undefined" cargo build
